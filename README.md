# Traffic Simulation Project
Welcome to the Traffic Simulation Project repository! This project is a Python-based traffic simulation developed using object-oriented programming principles. The aim of this simulation is to model and analyze traffic flow under various scenarios. Below you'll find information on the project's features, how to use it, and research conducted.

## Features
* Object-Oriented Design: The simulation is designed using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create modular and scalable code.
* Diverse Scenarios: Data is collected from diverse simulation scenarios to represent various traffic conditions, including different traffic volumes, scenarios with and without traffic lights, and various traffic light timing configurations.
* Data Processing and Visualization: Utilizes popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for efficient data processing, analysis, and visualization. This allows for clear interpretation of simulation results.

## How to Use
Running the "main" file will start the visualization of the infinite simulation. Additionally, you can adjust basic parameters within the main file.

## Research
The "research" notebook contains details of the traffic tests performed using the implemented simulation.
